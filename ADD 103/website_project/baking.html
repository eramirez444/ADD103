    <h2>How It Started</h2>
    <p>
      My love for baking began when I was a kid watching the Food Network channel. Seeing chefs
      prepare amazing dishes made me want to try it myself. My very first recipe was
      <strong>red velvet cupcakes</strong>. They didn’t turn out the way I wanted, but instead of
      quitting, I kept practicing until I improved.

    <h2>Family Influence</h2>
    <p>
      Both of my parents shaped my love for food. My dad, a food lover, showed me dishes from his
      home in Mexico, while my mom, who grew up in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, introduced me
      to her own home-style recipes. This gave me a balanced view of flavors and techniques.

    <h2>Why I Bake</h2>
    <p>
      Baking became more than just a hobby. It’s my way of relaxing and creating something that
      makes people happy. Every recipe I try is a chance to learn and share something special.
