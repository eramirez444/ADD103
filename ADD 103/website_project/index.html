    <h2>Where I Come From</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in <strong>Libertyville, Illinois</strong>, but my family has lived in
      <strong>McHenry County</strong> my entire life. On my father’s side, my family is from
      <strong>Ixtapan de la Sal, Mexico</strong>. My dad became a U.S. citizen in 2010, which
      has always inspired me to stay motivated and pursue my goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I’m an introverted but creative student who enjoys <strong>horror</strong>,
      <strong>writing</strong>, and <strong>baking</strong>. I’m currently studying both
      software development and graphic design at MCC. My sister Jackie—our family’s
      “gothic sister”—introduced me to horror, and it became a big part of my identity.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      My dream is to combine <strong>technology, design, and storytelling</strong> into a career.
      Whether that means working on creative media, design projects, or storytelling, I want to
      keep learning and creating things that connect with people.
