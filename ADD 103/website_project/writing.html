    <h2>My Love for Stories</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve always loved <strong>reading</strong>. Getting lost in books inspired me to create my
      own stories. Over time, I found myself drawn to writing <strong>short horror stories</strong>.
      The suspense and imagination involved make it incredibly fun.
    </p>

    <h2>Influences</h2>
    <p>
      Horror has been a constant in my life. My sister Jackie, the “gothic sister” in our family,
      introduced me to the genre. My aunt Michelle let me rent my first horror video back when
      rental stores were still around. <strong>Blockbuster was my sanctuary</strong> as a child,
      and those experiences left a lasting impact on me.

    <h2>How I Write</h2>
    <p>
      When I write, I focus on building atmosphere and suspense. I like short, impactful stories
      with endings that stay in your mind. Writing is more than a pastime—it’s a way to express
      creativity, explore emotions, and share ideas that matter to me.
