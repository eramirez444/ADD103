    <h2>What Makes Halloween Special</h2>

    <p style="color: ivory">
      Halloween, celebrated every October 31st, is a spooky and exciting holiday
      for people of all ages. It‚Äôs a time when the veil between the living and
      the dead is believed to be thinnest. The streets come alive with children
      dressed as witches, ghosts, and superheroes, going door-to-door asking for
      candy with the familiar phrase, ‚ÄúTrick or treat!‚Äù

    <h3>Traditions and Fun</h3>

    <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
      Halloween isn't just about candy‚Äîit's about community, creativity, and
      thrills. Many people decorate their homes with cobwebs, skeletons, and
      creepy lights. Haunted houses attract thrill-seekers, while pumpkin
      patches are full of families looking for the perfect carving pumpkin.

    <h3>More Than Just Costumes</h3>

    <p>
      Adults join in the fun with costume parties, scary movie nights, and
      themed baking. Popular treats include caramel apples, pumpkin-shaped
      cookies, and candy corn. In recent years, Halloween has grown to include
      parades, dog costume contests, and themed events in schools and
      workplaces.
